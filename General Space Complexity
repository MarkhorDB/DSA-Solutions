Common Space Complexities:
O(1): Constant space – Uses a fixed amount of space. Example: Simple variables.

O(n): Linear space – Space grows linearly with input size. Example: Using an array to store n elements.

O(n^2): Quadratic space – Space grows quadratically. Example: Storing a 2D array (matrix) with n x n elements.
